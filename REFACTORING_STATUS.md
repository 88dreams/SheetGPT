# SheetGPT Refactoring Status & Next Steps

## 1. Overall Goal

- Review the Database Query page functionality.
- Identify and significantly improve issues related to SQL query execution (both direct SQL and Natural Language Queries).
- Refactor large frontend (`DatabaseQuery.tsx`) and backend (`DatabaseManagementService`) components for better modularity, maintainability, and readability.

## 2. Backend Refactoring Summary (Completed)

The monolithic `src/services/database_management.py` service has been successfully refactored into several more focused services:

- **`src/services/query_service.py`**: Handles core query logic (NLQ translation, SQL validation, safe execution). Uses `AIQueryProcessor` abstraction.
- **`src/services/ai_query_processor.py`**: Defines the `AIQueryProcessor` interface and provides the `AnthropicAIProcessor` implementation, abstracting AI provider interactions.
- **`src/services/database_admin_service.py`**: Handles administrative tasks (backup, cleanup, vacuum, maintenance status). Includes conversation archiving methods temporarily.
- **`src/services/statistics_service.py`**: Handles gathering database statistics.
- **`src/services/export_service.py`**: Handles exporting data (file-based CSV, placeholder for Sheets).

**Key Improvements:**
- Introduced AI provider abstraction (`AIQueryProcessor`).
- Implemented basic caching for database schema info in `QueryService`.
- Improved separation of concerns.
- Standardized maintenance status updates in `DatabaseAdminService`.
- Fixed a `SyntaxError` in `DatabaseAdminService` related to the backup method.

**API Routes Updated:**
- Endpoints in `src/api/routes/db_management.py` (e.g., `/query`, `/stats`, `/backups`, `/export`) were updated to use the new services.

**Original Service Deleted:**
- `src/services/database_management.py` has been deleted.

## 3. Frontend Refactoring Summary (Partially Completed)

Refactoring of the large `frontend/src/pages/DatabaseQuery.tsx` component was started:

- **`frontend/hooks/useColumnManager.ts`**: Created and integrated. Manages state and logic for column visibility, order, sorting, and drag-and-drop.
- **`frontend/hooks/useQueryInput.ts`**: Created and integrated. Manages state and logic for query inputs (NLQ, SQL, name), translation, and validation display state.
- **`frontend/components/query/QueryResultsTable.tsx`**: Created and integrated. Renders the data table based on props, including adapter functions for D&D handlers.

**Result:** `DatabaseQuery.tsx` is significantly smaller, but further work was blocked.

## 4. Blocking Issues & Troubleshooting

Persistent errors prevented completion of the frontend refactoring:

- **Frontend Module Not Found Errors:** The editor consistently reported errors like "Cannot find module '@tanstack/react-query' (and similar for `antd`, `react-icons`)."
- **Docker/VS Code Workspace Mismatch:** Attempts to use the VS Code "Dev Containers" extension (recommended for fixing editor dependency issues) failed with errors like "Folder '/Users/.../SheetGPT' is not a subfolder of shared root folder '/Users/.../SheetGPT/src/api/routes'".

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
- Verified `frontend/Dockerfile` matches the documented fix (uses Yarn, clears cache, etc.).
- Verified `frontend/.dockerignore` includes `node_modules`.
- Verified `frontend/package.json` lists the required dependencies.
- Generated the missing `frontend/yarn.lock` file using `docker-compose run --rm frontend yarn install`.
- Executed Docker cleanup commands (`docker-compose down -v`, `docker-compose build --no-cache frontend`, `docker-compose up -d`).
- Verified Docker file sharing settings (VirtioFS shares `/Users` by default on Mac).
- Restarted VS Code and Docker Desktop multiple times.
- Verified VS Code Docker context is `default`.
- Confirmed no `.vscode/settings.json` exists in the project.
- **Identified Cause:** Discovered that VS Code was incorrectly identifying the workspace root as a deep subdirectory (`.../src/api/routes/`) instead of the actual project root (`SheetGPT/`). This mismatch caused the Dev Containers mounting error.

## 5. Current Status & Immediate Next Steps

The backend refactoring is complete. Frontend refactoring is partially complete but blocked by the VS Code workspace root issue preventing the use of Dev Containers.

**Action Required:**

1.  **Fix Workspace Root:**
    *   In VS Code, use `File -> Close Folder` or `File -> Close Workspace`.
    *   Use `File -> Open Folder...` and select the **top-level `SheetGPT` directory** (`/Users/lucas/Personal/P_CODE/SheetGPT`).
    *   Verify the VS Code window title/status bar now shows `SheetGPT` as the root.

2.  **Reconnect Dev Container:**
    *   Once the correct folder is open, use the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
    *   Run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
    *   If prompted, select the `frontend` service.
    *   Wait for VS Code to connect to the container.

3.  **Verify Frontend Build/Linting:**
    *   Once connected *inside* the Dev Container, check the VS Code "Problems" panel.
    *   The "Module Not Found" errors for `@tanstack/react-query`, `antd`, `react-icons` should now be resolved.

## 6. Subsequent Refactoring Steps (After Fixing Workspace/Dev Container)

Once the Dev Container is working and frontend errors are clear:

1.  **Fix CSV Export:** Update `exportExistingResults` in `DatabaseQuery.tsx` to handle the CSV `data` (or potentially `filename`) returned by the backend API and trigger a client-side download (e.g., using `Blob` and `URL.createObjectURL`).
2.  **Implement Sheets Export:** Add Google Sheets API client logic to `ExportService.export_data_to_sheets` on the backend.
3.  **Refine D&D Handler:** (Low priority) Clarify the exact arguments needed by `handleColumnDropInternal` in `useColumnManager` (called by `hookDrop` in `QueryResultsTable`) and update the call if necessary.
4.  **Continue Frontend Refactoring (Optional):**
    *   Extract query execution logic (`queryMutation`, `isExecuting`, related state/handlers) into `useQueryExecution` hook.
    *   Extract row selection logic into `useRowSelection` hook.
    *   Extract export logic into `useExporter` hook.
    *   Extract saved queries logic into `useSavedQueries` hook.
    *   Break down JSX further into components (`QueryInputPanel`, `ResultsToolbar`, `SavedQueriesList`).
5.  **Conversation Archiving:** Decide on the final location for `mark_conversation_archived` / `restore_archived_conversation` methods (currently in `DatabaseAdminService`) - potentially a new `ConversationService`.
