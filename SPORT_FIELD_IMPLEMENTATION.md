# Sport Field Enhancement Implementation

## Summary of Changes

The sport field enhancement has been implemented with the following changes:

### Backend Changes

1. **Entity Name Resolver Updates**
   - Updated `entity_name_resolver.py` to include the sport field when resolving League entities
   - Added league_sport to Team, Division/Conference, Broadcast Rights, and Production Services
   - Updated all related entity queries to fetch sport field from League table
   - Enhanced allowed fields to include league_sport across related entity types

2. **Schema Updates**
   - Added league_sport field to DivisionConferenceResponse
   - Added league_sport field to TeamResponse
   - Added league_sport field to BroadcastRightsResponse
   - Added league_sport field to ProductionServiceResponse

3. **Data Migration Script**
   - Created `update_league_sports.py` script to ensure all leagues have proper sport field values
   - Added mappings for common leagues and NCAA sports
   - Implemented logic to assign sport based on league name

### Frontend Changes

1. **DivisionConferenceFields Component**
   - Added read-only sport field display to Division/Conference form
   - Implemented state management to show the league's sport
   - Used Tag component to visually distinguish the sport field

## Running the Implementation

To apply these changes, follow these steps:

1. First, run the backend migration script to ensure all leagues have the sport field populated:
   ```
   docker-compose run --rm backend python src/scripts/update_league_sports.py
   ```

2. Restart the services to ensure proper schema loading:
   ```
   docker-compose restart backend frontend
   ```

3. Test the functionality by opening the following views in the UI:
   - Division/Conference edit form should show the league's sport
   - Team listings should include the sport column
   - Broadcast Rights listings should include the sport column
   - Production Services listings should include the sport column

## Next Steps

With these changes in place, users can now:
1. See the sport associated with leagues throughout the system
2. Filter entities by sport
3. Better organize NCAA sports divisions
4. Get more context for broadcast rights and production services

The implementation provides a good foundation for future enhancements such as:
- Adding sport-specific fields or validations
- Creating sport-based reports
- Implementing sport-based permissions
- Building cross-sport analytics
