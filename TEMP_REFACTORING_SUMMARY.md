# SheetGPT Refactoring & Dev Environment Setup Summary

**1. Overall Goal (from `REFACTORING_STATUS.md`):**

*   Review and significantly improve the functionality of the frontend "Database Query" page (`frontend/src/pages/DatabaseQuery.tsx`).
*   Address issues related to SQL query execution (both direct SQL and Natural Language Queries).
*   Refactor the large frontend component (`DatabaseQuery.tsx`) and the (now-deleted) backend service (`src/services/database_management.py`) for better modularity, maintainability, and readability.
*   Underlying Goal: Resolve persistent frontend dependency issues (like the historical TanStack Query version conflicts) and ensure a stable, consistent development environment using Docker Dev Containers.

**2. Backend Refactoring Status:**

*   **Completed:** The monolithic `src/services/database_management.py` was successfully refactored into several focused services:
    *   `src/services/query_service.py` (Core query logic, NLQ, validation)
    *   `src/services/ai_query_processor.py` (AI provider abstraction)
    *   `src/services/database_admin_service.py` (Admin tasks, backup, cleanup)
    *   `src/services/statistics_service.py` (DB stats)
    *   `src/services/export_service.py` (Data export)
*   Relevant API routes (`src/api/routes/db_management.py`) were updated.
*   The original `src/services/database_management.py` was deleted.

**3. Frontend Refactoring Status:**

*   **Partially Completed:** Refactoring of `frontend/src/pages/DatabaseQuery.tsx` was started:
    *   `frontend/hooks/useColumnManager.ts` created and integrated.
    *   `frontend/hooks/useQueryInput.ts` created and integrated.
    *   `frontend/components/query/QueryResultsTable.tsx` created and integrated.
*   **Blocked:** Further frontend refactoring was blocked by inability to get a stable Dev Container environment working, preventing effective debugging of numerous TypeScript errors that were also causing build failures.

**4. Dev Container Troubleshooting Detour (Summary):**

We undertook extensive troubleshooting to establish a working Dev Container connection for the `frontend` service. Key issues and fixes included:

*   **Workspace Root:** Corrected VS Code opening a deep subdirectory instead of the project root (`SheetGPT/`), which caused Docker mount errors.
*   **Dependency Management:** Confirmed consistent use of `yarn` and `yarn.lock` in `frontend/Dockerfile`. Generated missing `yarn.lock`.
*   **Root Dockerfile (`frontend-builder` stage):**
    *   Fixed missing `templates/` directory error during build.
    *   Corrected `COPY` commands and `WORKDIR` management for the `frontend/` context.
    *   Switched stage from `npm install` to `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to align with project standards.
    *   Added root `.dockerignore` to prevent local `frontend/node_modules` from overwriting installed ones during `COPY frontend/ ./frontend/`.
    *   Resolved persistent `error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for '''react-virtualized-auto-sizer'''` by:
        *   Debugging and confirming the `@types` directory *was* created by `yarn install` but the `index.d.ts` file was missing inside.
        *   Identifying that `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` bundles its own types.
        *   **Removing the conflicting `@types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer` dev dependency** from `frontend/package.json` and regenerating `yarn.lock`.
*   **VS Code Server Issues:**
    *   Resolved a 404 error downloading the VS Code/Cursor server for `alpine-arm64` by changing the base image in `frontend/Dockerfile` (and later the root `Dockerfile`'s `frontend-builder` stage) from `node:18-alpine` to `node:18-bullseye`.
*   **Dev Container Configuration (`.devcontainer/`):**
    *   Generated initial configuration based on `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Corrected `devcontainer.json`: Changed `workspaceFolder` from `/workspaces/...` to `/app` to match the actual code location defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Simplified `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` by removing conflicting/redundant `volumes` and `command` overrides.
    *   Set `remoteUser` to `node` in `devcontainer.json` (though this may not have been strictly necessary for the final fix).
*   **Extension Activation:** Troubleshooted missing "Dev Containers" output channel (restarts, checking logs, implicitly resolved).
*   **Build Cache:** Used `docker system prune` and explicit `docker compose build --no-cache app` repeatedly to overcome stubborn caching issues preventing fixes from taking effect.

**5. Current Status:**

*   **Successfully Connected:** We are now successfully connected to the `frontend` Dev Container environment via "Reopen in Container".
*   **Build Stable:** The underlying Docker image builds (including the `frontend-builder` stage) appear to be completing without the previous dependency/type resolution errors.

**6. Immediate Next Step:**

*   **Fix TypeScript Errors:** Address the numerous TypeScript errors (TS2322, TS2552, TS2339, TS2739, etc.) reported within the frontend codebase (`frontend/src/`). These errors were likely masked previously by the build failures but are now correctly identified by the TypeScript Language Server running inside the Dev Container.
    *   Use the "Problems" panel in VS Code/Cursor or run `yarn typecheck` in the integrated terminal to view and address these errors systematically.

**7. Subsequent Refactoring Goals (from `REFACTORING_STATUS.md`, after TS errors fixed):**

*   Fix CSV Export download trigger in `DatabaseQuery.tsx`.
*   Implement Sheets Export backend logic in `ExportService`.
*   Refine D&D handler `handleColumnDropInternal` in `useColumnManager` (Low priority).
*   Continue `DatabaseQuery.tsx` refactoring:
    *   Extract query execution logic (`useQueryExecution`).
    *   Extract row selection logic (`useRowSelection`).
    *   Extract export logic (`useExporter`).
    *   Extract saved queries logic (`useSavedQueries`).
    *   Break down JSX (`QueryInputPanel`, `ResultsToolbar`, `SavedQueriesList`).
*   Decide final location for conversation archiving methods (currently temporarily in `DatabaseAdminService`).
*   Restore `RUN yarn build` in the root `Dockerfile`'s `frontend-builder` stage (it should be correct now after the final edit).
