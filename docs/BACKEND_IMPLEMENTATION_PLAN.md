# Backend Implementation Plan for Sports Database

This document outlines the plan for implementing the backend API for the sports database functionality.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Implementation

### 1. Create Database Models

- Create SQLAlchemy models for all sports entities:
  - League
  - Team
  - Player
  - Game
  - Stadium
  - BroadcastRights
  - ProductionService
  - BrandRelationship

- Define relationships between entities:
  - League has many Teams
  - Team has many Players
  - Team plays in many Games (home and away)
  - Stadium hosts many Games
  - BroadcastRights, ProductionService, and BrandRelationship have polymorphic relationships with other entities

### 2. Create Pydantic Schemas

- Create request and response schemas for all entities
- Implement validation rules for each entity type
- Define relationship schemas for nested data

## Phase 2: API Endpoint Implementation

### 1. Basic CRUD Operations

- Implement GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints for each entity type
- Add filtering, sorting, and pagination to GET endpoints
- Implement proper error handling and validation

### 2. Relationship Endpoints

- Implement endpoints for retrieving related entities
- Add endpoints for managing relationships between entities
- Ensure proper cascading of operations (e.g., deleting a team should update related players)

### 3. Query Endpoints

- Implement generic entity query endpoint with type parameter
- Add support for retrieving entities with their relationships
- Implement search functionality with filtering options

## Phase 3: Export Functionality

### 1. Export Service

- Create a service for preparing data for export to Google Sheets
- Implement template-based export generation
- Add support for including relationships in exports

### 2. Export Endpoints

- Implement endpoint for exporting entities to Google Sheets
- Add endpoint for retrieving available export templates
- Create endpoint for previewing export data format

### 3. Google Sheets Integration

- Implement Google Sheets API integration
- Add support for creating and updating sheets
- Implement formatting rules for different entity types

## Phase 4: Guided Data Entry Support

### 1. Entity Validation

- Implement comprehensive validation for entity data
- Add support for relationship validation
- Create feedback mechanism for validation errors

### 2. Entity Creation from Chat

- Implement service for processing entity data from chat
- Add support for resolving relationships from text descriptions
- Create mechanism for handling ambiguous entity references

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Database Schema and Basic CRUD

- Day 1-2: Create database models and migrations
- Day 3-4: Implement Pydantic schemas and validation
- Day 5: Set up basic CRUD endpoints for all entity types

### Week 2: Relationships and Queries

- Day 1-2: Implement relationship endpoints
- Day 3-4: Create query endpoints with filtering
- Day 5: Add search functionality

### Week 3: Export Functionality

- Day 1-2: Implement export service
- Day 3-4: Create export endpoints
- Day 5: Add Google Sheets integration

### Week 4: Guided Data Entry and Testing

- Day 1-2: Implement entity validation for guided data entry
- Day 3-4: Create service for processing entity data from chat
- Day 5: Comprehensive testing and bug fixing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test each model and schema for proper validation
- Verify CRUD operations for each entity type
- Test relationship management functions

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints with various request scenarios
- Verify export functionality with different entity types
- Test guided data entry with sample chat inputs

### End-to-End Tests

- Test complete workflows from data entry to export
- Verify Google Sheets integration with actual exports
- Test error handling and edge cases
