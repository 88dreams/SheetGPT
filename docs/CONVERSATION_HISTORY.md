## Database Migration and Configuration

### Initial Migration Attempt

### Environment Configuration Update
- Updated `alembic/env.py` file to fix import issues
- Modified Python path configuration and model imports
- Added correct database URL configuration

### Migration Retry
- Attempted new migration with updated configuration
- Encountered error: `ImportError` for `Base` class from `src.models.models`

- Found model definitions including:
  - `User`
