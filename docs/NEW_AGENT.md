# SheetGPT Project Status for New Agent

## AGENT_INTRO
```
Welcome to the SheetGPT project! This document will help you quickly understand the current state of the project and what needs to be done next. Follow these steps to get up to speed:

1. **Project Overview**: 
   - SheetGPT is a full-stack application combining AI chat capabilities with structured data management and a sports database
   - The application extracts structured data from AI conversations, allows data manipulation, and supports sports entity management
   - Key components include: authentication system, chat interface, data management, sports database, and export functionality
   - The project uses a React/TypeScript frontend with FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL backend, all containerized with Docker

2. **Current Focus**:
   - We're currently focused on improving the SportsDatabase component with enhanced viewing, querying, and filtering capabilities
   - Recent work has fixed testing infrastructure for the SportDataMapper component and related hooks
   - Enhanced entity detail view with comprehensive information display
   - Added Fields View to display available fields for each entity type with required status and descriptions
   - Implemented sorting functionality across various views in the SportsDatabase component
   - Fixed stadium capacity parsing to handle formatted numbers (e.g., "20,500" → 20500)
   - Improved drag and drop functionality in the SportDataMapper component

3. **Key Files to Review**:
   - `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Contains detailed progress information and recent fixes
   - `docs/API_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Explains the API architecture and endpoints
   - `docs/TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md` - Provides technical details of major code sections
   - `frontend/src/pages/SportsDatabase.tsx` - The main component for viewing and managing sports entities
   - `frontend/src/pages/EntityDetail.tsx` - Component for displaying detailed entity information
   - `frontend/src/components/data/SportDataMapper.tsx` - Component for mapping structured data to sports entities
   - `frontend/src/services/SportsDatabaseService.ts` - Service for interacting with the sports database API
   - `frontend/src/jest-setup.ts` - Contains mocks for testing, including @headlessui/react components

4. **Development Environment**:
   - The project uses Docker for development with volume mounts for hot reloading
   - Frontend: React with TypeScript, React Query, and react-dnd for drag and drop
   - Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM and PostgreSQL
   - Start with `docker-compose up --build -d` to set up the development environment
   - Testing: Jest with React Testing Library for frontend components
   - Common commands are documented in the PROGRESS.md file under "Development Workflow"

5. **Current Challenges**:
   - Performance optimization for large datasets (pagination needed)
   - Completing Google Sheets export backend integration
   - Implementing advanced filtering capabilities for sports database entities
   - Enhancing data visualization for sports statistics
   - Standardizing data transformation process across components
   - Improving test coverage for frontend and backend components
   - Technical debt in the SportDataMapper component that needs refactoring

6. **Entity Relationships**:
   - Understand that Leagues and Stadiums are foundation entities that should be created first
   - Teams depend on Leagues and Stadiums
   - Players depend on Teams
   - Games depend on Teams, Leagues, and Stadiums
   - Other entities have various dependencies on these foundation entities
   - The SportDataMapper component helps users map structured data to these entity types

7. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - Chat → Structured Data → Data Management → Sports Database → Export
   - SportDataMapper bridges the gap between structured data and sports database entities
   - Multiple data formats are supported with comprehensive transformation logic
   - Entity detection helps recommend appropriate entity types based on data fields
   - Drag-and-drop interface allows mapping source fields to target entity fields

8. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Jest with React Testing Library for frontend components
   - Enhanced mocks for @headlessui/react components in jest-setup.ts
   - Custom render functions for components with complex dependencies
   - Comprehensive mocking for React DnD and other external libraries
   - Test challenges and solutions documented in TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md

When continuing development, prioritize:
1. Implementing advanced filtering capabilities for sports database entities
2. Enhancing data visualization for sports statistics
3. Creating more efficient data retrieval mechanisms for large datasets
4. Completing Google Sheets export backend integration
5. Implementing pagination for large datasets
6. Expanding test coverage for frontend and backend components

The code is well-structured but has some technical debt in the SportDataMapper component that needs refactoring for better organization. Focus on improving the user experience while maintaining the existing architecture. Refer to the "IMMEDIATE_TASKS" section for specific tasks that need attention.
