### Critical Information

1. **Database Schema**
   - All entities use UUID primary keys
   - Strict referential integrity
   - Required fields enforced at database level
   - Relationship tables for many-to-many
   - System tables for archiving and backups

2. **Entity Dependencies**
   Primary:
   - Leagues
   - Broadcast Companies
   - Production Companies
   - Brands
   
   Secondary:
   - Teams (requires leagues, stadiums)
   - Stadiums (requires broadcast companies)
   - Players (requires teams)
   
   Relationship:
   - Games (requires teams, stadiums)
   - Broadcast Rights
   - Production Services
   - Brand Relationships
   
   System:
   - Archived Conversations
   - Database Backups
   - Database Statistics

3. **Recent Changes**
   - Refactored large components into modular, focused components following established patterns
   - Implemented feature-based folder structure for complex features with logical organization
     ```
     ComponentName/
     â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # Child components
     â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/           # Custom hooks
     â”œâ”€â”€ utils/           # Helper utilities
     â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts         # Type definitions
     â””â”€â”€ index.tsx        # Main component
     ```
   - Extracted business logic into specialized custom hooks with single responsibility principle
   - Reorganized API client code into domain-specific services for better maintainability
   - Created advanced component organization patterns for consistent codebase
   - Improved type safety with dedicated type files and interfaces
   - Reduced file sizes for better maintainability (from 400-700 lines to under 100 lines per file)
   - Organized backend services into domain-specific modules:
     ```
     service_area/
     â”œâ”€â”€ specific_service1.py    # Focused responsibility
     â”œâ”€â”€ specific_service2.py    # Focused responsibility
     â””â”€â”€ __init__.py            # Exports service API
     ```
   - Implemented Facade pattern for service coordination
   - Integrated Claude API with robust error handling
   - Implemented fixed navigation bar across the entire application
   - Added conversation sorting by name, date, and manual order
   - Redesigned conversation list with table-based layout
   - Implemented contextual action buttons for selected conversations
   - Created enhanced extraction services architecture 
   - Added structured error handling with error utilities
   - Implemented database management system with backup/restore
   - Added conversation archiving with restore capability
   - Created database statistics dashboard for administrators
   - Built CLI tools for database maintenance
   - Added message repeat functionality to chat interface
   - Implemented entity list pagination with configurable page sizes
   - Added bulk delete functionality for entity management
   - Enhanced Teams Advanced Edit functionality
   - Improved relationship field handling with smart dropdowns
   - Added comprehensive field validation
   - Enhanced edit modal organization
   - Improved type handling for all fields

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Database Management**
   - Use CLI tools for manual database operations
   - Schedule backups using cron jobs
   - Archive instead of delete for important data
   - Monitor database growth patterns
   - Use provided restore tools for recovery

2. **Entity Creation**
   - Use name-based references when possible
   - System handles UUID conversion
   - Automatic entity creation for missing references

3. **Validation**
   - Validation occurs before mapping
   - Support for both UUID and name fields
   - Clear error messages for debugging
   - Real-time field validation in forms

4. **Data Import**
   - Batch import with progress tracking
   - Automatic relationship resolution
   - Error aggregation and reporting

5. **Entity Editing**
   - Use AdvancedEditForm for complex entities
   - Handle relationships through dropdowns
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Provide fallback error handling

### Required Reading
1. TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md - Detailed component documentation
2. SPORTS_API_ENDPOINTS.md - API endpoint specifications
3. API_ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture details
4. PROGRESS.md - Latest updates and status

### Next Actions
1. Complete Google Sheets integration
2. Enhance test coverage
3. Optimize performance for large datasets
4. Implement advanced search capabilities
5. Add mobile responsiveness
6. Enhance backup automation

### Communication Guidelines
1. Reference files and functions using exact paths
2. Use line numbers for specific code references
3. Follow TypeScript type definitions strictly
4. Maintain documentation consistency

### Error Handling Protocol
1. Check validation layer first
2. Verify entity relationships
3. Review transaction logs
4. Confirm client-side state
5. Validate API responses
6. Check database backup status

This document should be updated with each significant change to maintain accuracy for new agents.
