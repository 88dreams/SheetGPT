## Critical Information

1. **Entity Hierarchy**
   ```
   Primary:
   - Leagues (with optional nickname)
   - Broadcast Companies
   - Production Companies
   
   Secondary:
   - Division/Conferences (requires leagues)
   - Teams (requires leagues + division/conferences + stadiums)
   - Stadiums (may have host_broadcaster)
   - Players (requires teams)
   
   Relationship:
   - Games (requires teams + stadiums)
   - Broadcast Rights (may reference division/conferences)
   - Production Services
   ```

2. **Key Architecture Patterns**
   - UUID primary keys throughout with relationship mappings
   - Facade pattern in backend services to delegate to specialized services
   - Hook-based modular frontend with single responsibility hooks
   - Feature-focused folder structure for complex components
   - Streaming response architecture with buffer management
   - Entity name resolution with special character handling

## Common Issues and Quick Solutions

1. **Database Operations**
   - Database tools: `python src/scripts/db_management.py [command]`
   - Backup: `python src/scripts/db_management.py backup`
   - Stats: `python src/scripts/db_management.py stats`
   - Archive conversations instead of deleting them

2. **Entity Relationships**
   - Use name-based references when possible
   - System automatically resolves names to UUIDs
   - Respect entity creation order (primary â†’ secondary â†’ relationship)
   - Division/Conference entities require league_id
   - Teams require division_conference_id

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Extract context variables at component start
   - Add null checks before accessing nested properties
   - Use optimistic updates with proper error fallbacks
   - Apply React.memo for expensive components
   - Keep column visibility consistent between entity and query views

## Essential Documentation
- TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md - Component details
- API_ARCHITECTURE.md - Backend structure
- CLAUDE.md - AI integration specifics
- PROGRESS.md - Latest updates

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up

# Run backend tests
docker-compose run --rm backend pytest

# Run frontend tests
./run-tests.sh

# Apply database migrations
docker-compose run --rm backend python src/scripts/alembic_wrapper.py upgrade

# Create sample data
docker-compose run --rm backend python src/scripts/create_sample_sports_data.py
```

## Recent Key Improvements

1. **SportDataMapper Workflow** (March 31, 2025)
   - Separated mapping from data operations
   - Made league_id optional for broadcast rights
   - Added default dates for missing fields
   - Improved entity type detection from content
   - Enhanced error handling for constraints

2. **Component Architecture** (March 17-20, 2025)
