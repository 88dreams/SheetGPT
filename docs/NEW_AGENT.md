# SheetGPT Project Status for New Agent

## AGENT_INTRO
```
Welcome to the SheetGPT project! This document will help you quickly understand the current state of the project and what needs to be done next. Follow these steps to get up to speed:

1. **Project Overview**: 
   - SheetGPT is a full-stack application combining AI chat capabilities with structured data management and a sports database
   - The application extracts structured data from AI conversations, allows data manipulation, and supports sports entity management
   - Key components include: authentication system, chat interface, data management, sports database, and export functionality
   - The project uses a React/TypeScript frontend with FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL backend, all containerized with Docker

2. **Current Focus**:
   - Improving the SportsDatabase component with enhanced viewing, querying, and filtering capabilities
   - Implementing advanced filtering for sports database entities
   - Enhancing data visualization for sports statistics
   - Completing Google Sheets export backend integration
   - Optimizing performance for large datasets with pagination

3. **Recent Achievements**:
   - Enhanced Field Mapping Visualization with improved font sizes, column widths, and data display
   - Fixed the display order in the Connections column to correctly show Source → Database
   - Implemented pagination for large datasets in the DataTable component
   - Added server-side pagination support with skip/limit parameters in the API
   - Fixed testing infrastructure for the SportDataMapper component
   - Enhanced entity detail view with comprehensive information display

4. **Key Files to Review**:
   - `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Contains detailed progress information and recent fixes
   - `docs/API_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Explains the API architecture and endpoints
   - `docs/TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md` - Provides technical details of major code sections
   - `frontend/src/components/data/DataTable.tsx` - The main component for displaying structured data with pagination
   - `frontend/src/pages/SportsDatabase.tsx` - The main component for viewing and managing sports entities
   - `frontend/src/components/data/SportDataMapper/components/FieldMappingArea.tsx` - Component for mapping fields
   - `frontend/src/components/data/SportDataMapper/hooks/useDataManagement.ts` - Hook for managing data in the SportDataMapper

5. **Development Environment**:
   - Docker-based development with volume mounts for hot reloading
   - Start with `docker-compose up --build -d` to set up the environment
   - Frontend: React with TypeScript, React Query, and react-dnd for drag and drop
   - Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM and PostgreSQL
   - Testing: Jest with React Testing Library for frontend components

6. **Entity Relationships**:
   - Leagues and Stadiums are foundation entities that should be created first
   - Teams depend on Leagues and Stadiums
   - Players depend on Teams
   - Games depend on Teams, Leagues, and Stadiums
   - The SportDataMapper component helps users map structured data to these entity types

7. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - Chat → Structured Data → Data Management → Sports Database → Export
   - SportDataMapper bridges the gap between structured data and sports database entities
   - Multiple data formats are supported with comprehensive transformation logic
   - Entity detection helps recommend appropriate entity types based on data fields

8. **Documentation Structure**:
   - `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions
   - `PROGRESS.md` - Detailed progress updates and recent improvements
   - `API_ARCHITECTURE.md` - API structure and endpoint documentation
   - `TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md` - Technical details of major code sections
   - `NEW_AGENT.md` (this file) - Quick start guide for new AI agents

When continuing development, prioritize:
1. Implementing advanced filtering capabilities for sports database entities
2. Enhancing data visualization for sports statistics
3. Completing Google Sheets export backend integration
4. Expanding test coverage for frontend and backend components
5. Refactoring the SportDataMapper component for better maintainability
