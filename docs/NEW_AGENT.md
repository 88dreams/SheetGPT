## TECHNICAL_NOTES
```
- The project uses a Docker-based development environment with volume mounts for hot reloading
- Frontend and backend are separate services in docker-compose
- Data transformation is a critical component handling various JSON formats
- The "Send to Data" feature now includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- The DataTable component has been enhanced to handle various data formats
- The MessageThread component implements async/await for better control over asynchronous operations
- The application uses TypeScript for type safety, with proper typing for data structures
- Data extraction from chat messages uses regex to find JSON structures
- State management has been improved to handle race conditions and timing issues
- The application implements verification steps to ensure data creation success

## DEBUGGING_NOTES
```
- When troubleshooting "Send to Data" issues, check browser console for logs from MessageThread.tsx
- Data transformation logs in DataTable.tsx provide insights into how data is being processed
- After making changes to components, always restart the frontend container with docker-compose restart frontend
- TypeScript errors related to data typing are common when modifying data structures
- Race conditions in asynchronous operations can cause inconsistent behavior
- State management issues often manifest as components not updating properly
- Check for duplicate data entries in the database when troubleshooting data creation issues
- The verification process includes multiple checks to ensure data is created successfully
- Timing issues can occur if navigation happens before backend processing completes
