# NEW AGENT INTRODUCTION

## AGENT INTRO SECTION

### Project Overview
SheetGPT is a full-stack application combining AI-powered chat with structured data management and sports database functionality. Key capabilities:
- AI chat for data extraction and structuring
- Tabular data management with column controls
- Sports entity management (leagues, teams, players, etc.)
- Google Sheets export integration

### Technical Architecture

#### Backend
- FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM and PostgreSQL
- JWT authentication with role-based access
- Modular design with isolated services
- Transaction management with session control

#### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- React Query for data management
- Advanced DataTable component
- Sports database interface with relationship visualization

### Key Components

1. **Entity Reference Resolution System**
   - Flexible reference system (UUID/name-based)
   - Validation layer (`validationUtils.ts`)
   - Mapping layer (`mappingUtils.ts`)
   - Automatic entity creation and lookup

2. **SportDataMapper**
   - Field mapping with drag-and-drop
   - Entity type detection
   - Batch import capabilities
   - Progress tracking
   - Record navigation

3. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Hybrid approach (backend/client-side)
   - Multiple filter types and operators
   - Filter persistence
   - Dynamic query building

### Current Status (March 2025)

#### Completed Features
- âœ… User authentication and management
- âœ… Chat interface with AI integration
- âœ… Structured data extraction
- âœ… Sports database with comprehensive models
- âœ… Frontend-backend integration
- âœ… Admin functionality
- âœ… Enhanced field mapping visualization
- âœ… Hybrid filtering implementation
- âœ… Bulk operations for entities

#### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Google Sheets API backend integration
- ðŸ”„ Sports database API endpoint testing
- ðŸ”„ Error handling improvements
- ðŸ”„ Frontend component test coverage

### Critical Information

1. **Database Schema**
   - All entities use UUID primary keys
   - Strict referential integrity
   - Required fields enforced at database level
   - Relationship tables for many-to-many

2. **Entity Dependencies**
   Primary:
   - Leagues
   - Broadcast Companies
   - Production Companies
   - Brands
   
   Secondary:
   - Teams (requires leagues)
   - Stadiums (requires broadcast companies)
   - Players (requires teams)
   
   Relationship:
   - Games (requires teams, stadiums)
   - Broadcast Rights
   - Production Services
   - Brand Relationships

3. **Recent Changes**
   - Enhanced name-based entity references
   - Improved validation order
   - Fixed bulk operations
   - Updated field mapping visualization

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Entity Creation**
   - Use name-based references when possible
   - System handles UUID conversion
   - Automatic entity creation for missing references

2. **Validation**
   - Validation occurs before mapping
   - Support for both UUID and name fields
   - Clear error messages for debugging

3. **Data Import**
   - Batch import with progress tracking
   - Automatic relationship resolution
   - Error aggregation and reporting

### Required Reading
1. TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md - Detailed component documentation
2. SPORTS_API_ENDPOINTS.md - API endpoint specifications
3. API_ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture details
4. PROGRESS.md - Latest updates and status

### Next Actions
1. Complete Google Sheets integration
2. Enhance test coverage
3. Optimize performance for large datasets
4. Implement advanced search capabilities
5. Add mobile responsiveness

### Communication Guidelines
1. Reference files and functions using exact paths
2. Use line numbers for specific code references
3. Follow TypeScript type definitions strictly
4. Maintain documentation consistency

### Error Handling Protocol
1. Check validation layer first
2. Verify entity relationships
3. Review transaction logs
4. Confirm client-side state
5. Validate API responses

This document should be updated with each significant change to maintain accuracy for new agents.
