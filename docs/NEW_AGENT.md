# SheetGPT Project Status for New Agent

## AGENT_INTRO
```
Welcome to the SheetGPT project! This document will help you quickly understand the current state of the project and what needs to be done next. Follow these steps to get up to speed:

1. **Project Overview**: 
   - SheetGPT is a full-stack application combining AI chat capabilities with structured data management and a sports database
   - The application extracts structured data from AI conversations, allows data manipulation, and supports sports entity management
   - Key components include: authentication system, chat interface, data management, sports database, and export functionality

2. **Current Focus**:
   - We're currently focused on improving the SportDataMapper component for better usability and data mapping
   - Recent work has fixed drag and drop functionality and added guidance for League and Stadium entity types
   - Entity type detection has been enhanced to better identify the correct entity type based on data

3. **Key Files to Review**:
   - `frontend/src/components/data/SportDataMapper.tsx` - The main component for mapping structured data to sports entities
   - `frontend/src/services/SportsDatabaseService.ts` - Service for interacting with the sports database API
   - `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Contains detailed progress information and recent fixes
   - `docs/API_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Explains the API architecture and endpoints
   - `docs/TECHNICAL_DESCRIPTION.md` - Provides technical details of major code sections

4. **Development Environment**:
   - The project uses Docker for development with volume mounts for hot reloading
   - Frontend: React with TypeScript, React Query, and react-dnd for drag and drop
   - Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM and PostgreSQL
   - Start with `docker-compose up --build -d` to set up the development environment

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Review the "IMMEDIATE_TASKS" section below for priority tasks
   - Focus on the "sportdatamapper_improvements" for specific enhancements needed
   - Check "RECENT_CHANGES" to understand what has been recently modified
   - Refer to "TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE" if you encounter common issues

6. **Entity Relationships**:
   - Understand that Leagues and Stadiums are foundation entities that should be created first
   - Teams depend on Leagues and Stadiums
   - Players depend on Teams
   - Games depend on Teams, Leagues, and Stadiums
   - Other entities have various dependencies on these foundation entities

7. **Recent Database Changes**:
   - Added missing fields to GameBroadcast (start_time, end_time)
   - Added end_date to LeagueExecutive
   - Renamed title to position in LeagueExecutive

When continuing development, prioritize:
1. Enhancing the batch import process with better progress visualization
2. Implementing field value preview for better mapping decisions
3. Adding field type validation to prevent mismatches
4. Improving entity relationship handling with visual indicators
5. Implementing field mapping templates for common data sources

The code is well-structured but has some technical debt in the SportDataMapper component that needs refactoring for better organization. Focus on improving the user experience while maintaining the existing architecture.
