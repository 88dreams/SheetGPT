- Frontend and backend are separate services in docker-compose
- Data transformation is a critical component handling various JSON formats
- The "Send to Data" feature includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- The DataTable component has been enhanced with improved column resizing and grid expansion
- Column resizing now uses direct width updates during mouse movement for smoother UX
- Grid expansion dynamically adjusts height based on content with smooth transitions
- Comprehensive logging has been added throughout the data transformation process
- Event listener cleanup has been improved to prevent memory leaks
- The application uses TypeScript for type safety, with proper typing for data structures
- Export to Sheets UI implementation is complete but awaiting backend integration
- Z-index management has been improved for better interaction with overlapping elements
- The backend uses SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL for database operations
- UUID fields in database models use SQLUUID type for proper handling
- Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens with secure password hashing
- The sports database includes comprehensive models for leagues, teams, players, games, etc.
- The export service integrates with Google Sheets API for data export

## DEBUGGING_NOTES
```
- DataTable component now has comprehensive logging in transformData function to track data flow
- Check browser console for logs prefixed with "DataTable:" for transformation debugging
- Column resizing issues can be diagnosed by checking event listener attachment/detachment
- Grid expansion issues may relate to height calculations or state management
- "Send to Data" functionality has detailed logging throughout the process
- When troubleshooting data transformation, check logs for data structure type and format
- Export functionality UI is complete but backend integration is still pending
- After making changes to components, restart the frontend container with docker-compose restart frontend
- Memory leaks have been addressed with improved event listener cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Z-index issues have been resolved for better interaction with overlapping elements
- Raw data display now has better formatting and toggle controls
