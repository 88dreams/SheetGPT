## Critical Information

1. **Database Schema**
   - All entities use UUID primary keys
   - Strict referential integrity
   - Required fields enforced at database level
   - Relationship tables for many-to-many
   - System tables for archiving and backups

2. **Entity Dependencies**
   Primary:
   - Leagues
   - Broadcast Companies
   - Production Companies
   
   Secondary:
   - Division/Conferences (requires leagues)
   - Teams (requires leagues, division/conferences, stadiums)
   - Stadiums (requires broadcast companies)
   - Players (requires teams)
   
   Relationship:
   - Games (requires teams, stadiums)
   - Broadcast Rights
   - Production Services
   
   System:
   - Archived Conversations
   - Database Backups
   - Database Statistics

3. **Recent Changes**
   - Added DivisionConference model as sub-unit of Leagues
   - Created hierarchical relationship: League â†’ Division/Conference â†’ Team
   - Refactored large components into modular, focused components
   - Implemented feature-based folder structure for complex features
   - Extracted business logic into specialized custom hooks

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Database Management**
   - Use CLI tools for database operations: `python src/scripts/db_management.py [command]`
   - Schedule backups using cron jobs
   - Archive instead of delete for important data
   - Monitor database growth patterns
   - Use provided restore tools for recovery

2. **Entity Creation**
   - Use name-based references when possible
   - System handles UUID conversion
   - Automatic entity creation for missing references
   - Ensure EntityType definitions are consistent across the codebase
   - Use dynamic field generation for consistent column handling

3. **Validation**
   - Validation occurs before mapping
   - Support for both UUID and name fields
   - Clear error messages for debugging
   - Real-time field validation in forms
   - Add proper error handling for undefined values
   - Use null checks before accessing properties
   - Extract context functions before using them

4. **Data Import**
   - Batch import with progress tracking
   - Automatic relationship resolution
   - Error aggregation and reporting
   - Ensure context data is available before use
   - Handle field mapping consistently across views

5. **Entity Editing**
   - Use AdvancedEditForm for complex entities
   - Handle relationships through dropdowns
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Provide fallback error handling
   - Structure components to fetch context data before rendering
   - Add defensive programming for potential undefined values
   - Use unified column visibility controls
   - Generate UI elements dynamically from schema

6. **Component Rendering**
   - Access context data at the beginning of components
   - Provide safe fallbacks for missing or undefined values
   - Add conditional rendering for potentially missing data
   - Handle loading states explicitly
   - Create consistent error displays for data issues
   - Standardize column visibility between entity and query views
   - Extract reusable rendering logic for different components
