## Authentication System Improvements (Feb 21, 2024)

### Authentication Flow Optimization
- Fixed race condition in login process that required double login
- Improved token management and auth state updates
- Added throttling to prevent excessive auth checks (5-second minimum interval)
- Implemented proper mounting/unmounting checks for components
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging auth flow

### Key Changes
1. Login Function Enhancement:
   - Direct user data fetch after successful token acquisition
   - Immediate auth state updates without relying on checkAuthStatus
   - Better error handling and state management
   - Proper cleanup on unmount

2. Auth Check Optimization:
   - Added throttling mechanism (5s interval)
   - Prevented simultaneous auth checks
   - Improved token validation logic
   - Better error handling for 401 responses

3. Component Lifecycle:
   - Added mount status tracking
   - Prevented state updates after unmount
   - Improved cleanup on component unmount

### Current Status
- Login flow working correctly with single attempt
- Auth state properly maintained across page transitions
- Token management working as expected
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Next Steps
1. Implement token refresh mechanism
2. Add remember me functionality
3. Enhance security measures
4. Add session timeout handling
