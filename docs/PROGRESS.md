5. Entity List Pagination
   - Configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50, 100)
   - First/last page navigation
   - Total count display
   - Optimized performance for large datasets

6. Bulk Operations
   - Multi-select entity deletion
   - Progress tracking
   - Error aggregation
   - Optimistic updates
