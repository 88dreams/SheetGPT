# SheetGPT Progress Summary

## Project Overview

SheetGPT combines AI-powered chat with structured data management and a sports database. Core capabilities:

- Claude-powered chat with data extraction
- Sports database with comprehensive entity relationships 
- Interactive data mapping and transformation
- Natural language database queries
- Google Sheets integration and CSV export
- Database maintenance and archiving

## Latest Improvements (March 2025)

### Entity Persistence Enhancements (March 25)

- Implemented robust column persistence across sessions and logins
- Added dual storage strategy with both localStorage and sessionStorage
- Enhanced entity name resolution for Production Services
- Fixed Entity Name display to show actual entity names instead of types
- Removed "(Brand)" suffix from company names
- Ensured column order and visibility preferences persist between logins

### Production Services Display Fix (March 24)

- Fixed production service display showing "N/A" for company names
- Updated backend to properly join ProductionService with Brand
- Fixed production company creation to match the database schema
- Ensured the UI properly displays brand names with entity names
- Added explicit handling for the Brand-based architecture
- Updated entity display with proper column visibility rules

### Special Entity Types Support (March 26)

- Added support for Championships and Playoffs as virtual entity types
- Implemented deterministic UUID generation for consistency
- Enhanced schema validation to support both UUID and string entity IDs
- Removed the need for dedicated database tables for special entities
- Added special handling in entity lookup API for virtual entities

### Universal Company Entity Implementation (March 25)

- Implemented Brand as the universal entity for all companies
- Added `company_type` and `country` fields to Brand model
- Created direct relationships between Brand and production/broadcast services
- Fixed production services to use Brand entities directly
- Enhanced name-to-ID resolution for dynamic company creation
- Added database migration utilities for entity conversion

### UI Component Optimization (March 28-29)

- Fixed broadcast rights name field interpretation
- Rewrote useDragAndDrop hook to eliminate circular dependencies
- Implemented column order persistence across navigation
- Fixed critical infinite loop in SmartEntitySearch component
- Enhanced error display with non-dismissing notifications
- Fixed production service entity validation
- Added name-to-ID resolution for production services

### Authentication & API Improvements (March 23)

- Fixed critical backend startup error in database_management.py
- Properly initialized services for natural language to SQL translation
- Updated endpoints to include required service dependencies
- Fixed React dependency cycles in Query component
- Resolved "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- Enhanced natural language query with relationship information

### Entity Management Features (March 19-21)

- Implemented dual-ID solution for brand-broadcast company integration
- Added accurate league resolution for broadcast rights
- Implemented year-only date handling (e.g., "2020" → "2020-01-01")
- Added inline nickname editing with color-coded badges
- Enhanced entity name resolution with parentheses support
- Fixed record navigation with circular traversal in SportDataMapper

## Architecture Improvements

### Component Architecture

- Single-responsibility hooks:
  - useEntityData (data fetching)
  - useEntitySelection (selection management)
  - useFiltering (filter operations)
  - useSorting (type-aware sorting)
  - useEntitySchema (field definitions)
  - useDragAndDrop (column reordering)

- Feature-focused organization:
  ```
  FeatureName/
  ├── components/      # UI components
  ├── hooks/           # Feature-specific hooks
  ├── utils/           # Helper functions
  └── types.ts         # Type definitions
  ```

- Performance optimization:
  - Strategic memoization to prevent unnecessary renders
  - Reference stability for complex objects
  - Breaking circular dependency chains
  - State management with proper cleanup
  - Conditional updates to prevent infinite loops

### Backend Design

- Facade pattern for service coordination
- Universal Brand entity for company relationships
- Virtual entity support without database tables
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages

## Known Issues

- **Conversation Reordering**: Drag-and-drop reordering needs improvement (low priority)
- **Google Sheets Export**: Occasional authentication issues (medium priority)

## Recent Resolutions

- ✓ Entity Type standardization across codebase
- ✓ Special character handling in entity names
- ✓ Record navigation with proper state management
- ✓ Production company creation with unified Brand model
- ✓ Production service display with proper Brand relationships
- ✓ Database query improvements with multi-level extraction

## Current Focus

1. **Data Export & Management**
   - Google Sheets export reliability
   - CSV export fallback implementation
   - Pagination optimization

2. **Testing & Quality**
   - API endpoint test coverage
   - Entity operation validation
   - Error recovery scenarios

3. **User Experience**
   - Field validation improvements
   - Relationship constraint messaging
   - Multiple export format options

## Next Steps (1-2 months)

- Complete export reliability improvements
- Expand test coverage for critical functionality
- Enhance error handling with better user guidance
- Mobile responsive design implementation
- Performance optimization for large datasets
