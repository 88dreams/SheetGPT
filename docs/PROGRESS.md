### Implementation Plan
1. Centralize data transformation in the `dataTransformer` utility
2. Remove special case handling for NFL teams data
3. Standardize the data extraction process
4. Simplify the display components to use a consistent data format
5. Implement a cleaner data flow from extraction to display
6. Add comprehensive logging for better traceability

The data handling refactoring aims to address the current issues with data transformation and display, ensuring consistent and efficient handling of data across the application. By centralizing data transformation and simplifying the transformation pipeline, we aim to reduce redundant code and improve performance. The implementation plan involves centralizing data transformation in the `dataTransformer` utility, removing special case handling for NFL teams data, and standardizing the data extraction process. This will create a single source of truth for data format conversion, improve performance by minimizing unnecessary data processing, and enhance debugging with consistent logging.
