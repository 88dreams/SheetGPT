# SheetGPT Progress Summary

This document provides a concise summary of the project's progress, current status, and next steps.

## Project Overview

SheetGPT is a full-stack application that combines AI-powered chat capabilities with structured data management and sports database functionality. The application allows users to:

1. Chat with an AI assistant to extract and structure data
2. Manage and transform structured data in a tabular format
3. Create and manage sports-related entities (leagues, teams, players, etc.)
4. Export data to Google Sheets for further analysis and sharing

## Development Workflow

The project uses Docker for development with volume mounts for hot reloading:
- Frontend uses Vite with HMR
- Backend uses uvicorn with --reload flag
- Database is PostgreSQL 15

Common commands:
- Setup: `docker-compose up --build -d`
- Install frontend dependency: `docker-compose exec frontend npm install [package-name]`
- Run migrations: `docker-compose exec backend python src/scripts/alembic_wrapper.py upgrade`
- Database access: `docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d sheetgpt`
- Restart frontend: `docker-compose restart frontend`
- Clean database: Use the admin interface in Settings page
- Rebuild containers with dependencies: `docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d`
- Set user as admin: `docker-compose exec backend python src/scripts/set_admin.py <email>`

## SportDataMapper Component Refactoring

### Completed Tasks
- Extracted smaller components from the original SportDataMapper component:
  - FieldHelpTooltip: Provides contextual help for different field types
  - FieldItem: Represents a draggable/droppable field in the UI
  - GuidedWalkthrough: Provides step-by-step guidance for users

- Created utility modules for better organization:
  - entityTypes.ts: Defines entity types and their required fields
  - entityDetection.ts: Logic for detecting entity types from data
  - validationUtils.ts: Validation logic for different entity types
  - mappingUtils.ts: Functions for mapping fields and data transformation
  - uiUtils.ts: UI-related helper functions
  - index.ts: Exports all utility functions

- Created custom hooks for better state management:
  - useFieldMapping: Manages field mapping functionality
  - useRecordNavigation: Handles record navigation and exclusion
  - useImportProcess: Manages database saving and batch import operations
  - useUiState: Manages UI state like view mode, guided walkthrough, and field help
  - useDataManagement: Manages data operations like extraction and transformation

- Developed a new main container component (SportDataMapperContainer) that:
  - Uses the extracted utility functions
  - Implements the custom hooks
  - Maintains the same functionality as the original component
  - Provides a cleaner, more maintainable structure

### Next Steps
- Complete the UI implementation in the SportDataMapperContainer
- Update the original SportDataMapper component to use the new structure
- Add tests for the new components and utility functions
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

### Current Status
The refactoring is progressing well. The component structure is now more modular and maintainable. All custom hooks have been implemented and integrated into the main container component. The next focus will be on completing the UI implementation and ensuring all functionality works as expected.
