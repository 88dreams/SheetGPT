# SheetGPT Progress Summary

## Project Overview

SheetGPT is a full-stack application that combines AI-powered chat capabilities with structured data management and sports database functionality. The application enables:

1. AI-assisted data extraction and structuring
2. Structured data management and transformation
3. Sports entity management (leagues, teams, players, etc.)
4. Google Sheets integration for data export
5. Database maintenance and backup capabilities

## Current Status (March 2025)

   - Implemented empty field handling that preserves existing values when appropriate
   - Added clear visual indicators for fields that will be cleared
   - Created batch processing with progress tracking
   - Added success/failure reporting with detailed results
   - Optimized performance with batched update requests

2. Division/Conference Model Addition (March 13, 2025)
   - Added DivisionConference model as sub-unit of Leagues 
   - Created hierarchical relationship: League â†’ Division/Conference â†’ Team
   - Modified Team model to require division/conference assignment
   - Added appropriate database constraints and relationships
   - Created sample data population scripts with sport-specific naming conventions

2. Database Query System
   - Implemented direct SQL query execution with safety checks
   - Added natural language to SQL conversion using Claude AI
   - Built query saving and management functionality
   - Enhanced UI with side-by-side view of natural language query and SQL
   - Added "Translate" button to generate SQL without executing queries
   - Integrated robust CSV export with client-side file generation
   - Implemented Google Sheets export with authentication flow

3. Claude API Integration
   - Implemented Anthropic Claude 3 API integration
   - Enhanced chat streaming capabilities
   - Created robust error handling with fallbacks
   - Built conversation state management with context optimization
   - Leveraged Claude for natural language query processing

4. Enhanced Data Extraction Services
   - Created modular extraction service architecture
   - Implemented specialized detection, parsing, and extraction services
   - Built robust error handling with graceful failure modes
   - Added session storage fallback for API failures

### Known Issues

1. Conversation Reordering
   - Drag and drop reordering in conversation list is not functioning reliably
   - Initial implementation with React DnD has UI interactions but state updates inconsistently
   - Temporary solution uses the up/down arrow buttons for reordering
   - Planning to revisit with simplified implementation using react-beautiful-dnd library
   - Current priority: Low (core functionality unaffected)

2. Entity Type Definition Inconsistencies
   - Fixed inconsistency between EntityType definitions in different files
   - Standardized EntityType across the codebase to include all entity types
   - Previous mismatch caused blank screens in the entity view
   - Added proper error handling for entity type validation
   - Current priority: Resolved (fix implemented)

3. Entity List Column Visibility
   - Previously hardcoded columns in EntityList resulted in inconsistent views between Entity List and Query Results
   - Implemented dynamic column generation for all entity fields
   - Added unified column visibility controls across the application
   - Standardized column handling for all entity types
   - Current priority: Resolved (fix implemented)

### Recent Improvements

#### Code Refactoring and Architecture
- Implemented a modular component structure with clear separation of concerns
- Refactored large components into smaller, focused components (DataTable, Chat, DataManagement)
- Extracted business logic into specialized custom hooks with single responsibility
- Created domain-specific API clients with improved maintainability
- Reorganized backend services into modular, feature-focused modules
- Implemented Facade pattern for service coordination
- Improved type safety with dedicated type definitions and interfaces
- Reduced file sizes for better maintainability (some files reduced from 600+ lines to under 100)

#### UI Improvements
- Fixed navbar that stays at top of screen throughout the application
- Redesigned conversation list with improved sorting capabilities (by name, date, or manual order)
- Enhanced conversation item display with contextual action buttons
- Implemented more efficient selection mechanisms
- Created responsive design elements that adapt to different screen sizes

#### Database Maintenance
- Added `DatabaseManagementService` for comprehensive DB operations
- Implemented conversation archiving with restore capability
- Created automated backup system with pg_dump integration
- Added database statistics dashboard for administrators
- Built CLI tools for database management tasks
