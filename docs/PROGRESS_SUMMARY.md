# SheetGPT Progress Summary

This document provides a concise summary of the project's progress, current status, and next steps.

## Project Overview

SheetGPT is a full-stack application that combines AI-powered chat capabilities with structured data management and sports database functionality. The application allows users to:

1. Chat with an AI assistant to extract and structure data
2. Manage and transform structured data in a tabular format
3. Create and manage sports-related entities (leagues, teams, players, etc.)
4. Export data to Google Sheets for further analysis and sharing

## Current Status (May 2024)

## Current Challenges

1. **Google Sheets Integration**: Completing the backend integration for exporting data to Google Sheets
2. **Performance Optimization**: Handling large datasets efficiently with pagination and caching
3. **Data Transformation**: Standardizing the process across components and improving handling of complex structures
4. **Testing**: Implementing comprehensive test coverage for backend services
5. **Error Handling**: Enhancing error handling and user feedback throughout the application

## Recent Fixes

1. **UUID Handling**: Fixed issues with UUID handling in database models by using SQLUUID type
2. **Import Path Resolution**: Updated import paths to reflect correct directory structure
3. **Authentication Utility**: Created auth.py utility to provide get_current_user function
4. **Column Resizing**: Enhanced with direct width updates during mouse movement
5. **Grid Expansion**: Improved with dynamic height adjustment based on content
6. **Data Transformation**: Added comprehensive logging and improved error handling

## Development Workflow

The project uses Docker for development with volume mounts for hot reloading:
- Frontend uses Vite with HMR
- Backend uses uvicorn with --reload flag
- Database is PostgreSQL 15

Common commands:
- Setup: `docker-compose up --build -d`
- Install frontend dependency: `docker-compose exec frontend npm install [package-name]`
- Run migrations: `docker-compose exec backend python src/scripts/alembic_wrapper.py upgrade`
- Database access: `docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d sheetgpt`
- Restart frontend: `docker-compose restart frontend`
