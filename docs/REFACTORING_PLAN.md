  - [ ] Optimize complex search queries
  - [ ] Improve relation-based filtering

- [ ] **Upgrade data validation**
  - [ ] Implement consistent validation patterns
  - [ ] Add comprehensive relationship validation
  - [ ] Improve feedback for validation errors

## Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure (Low Risk, High Value)

- [ ] **Expand test coverage**
  - [ ] Add tests for critical paths
  - [ ] Focus on high-value business logic
  - [ ] Create test factories for consistent test data
  - [x] Implement isolated unit tests for error handling components
  - [ ] Add mocking strategies for SQLAlchemy interactions

- [ ] **Implement integration testing**
  - [ ] Develop more robust integration test framework
  - [ ] Test complete workflows across frontend and backend
  - [ ] Automate end-to-end testing for critical paths

- [ ] **Enhance CI/CD pipeline**
  - [ ] Improve test automation in deployment
  - [ ] Add performance regression testing
  - [ ] Implement code quality gates

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **For every change:**
   - Create a feature branch for isolated development
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Validate both functionality and performance
   - Deploy to staging for thorough testing before production

2. **Communication strategy:**
   - Document each refactoring phase in advance
   - Schedule changes during lower usage periods
   - Provide clear rollback procedures
   - Communicate any brief maintenance windows

3. **Verification approach:**
   - Automated tests for all changes
   - Visual regression testing for UI components
   - Performance benchmarking before and after
   - Database integrity validation for data model changes

## Phase 3 Achievements

1. **Identified and resolved circular hook dependencies**:
   - ✅ SportDataMapper hooks had circular dependencies creating endless update cycles
   - ✅ Created a clean architecture with single-responsibility hooks
   - ✅ Separated UI state from data operations completely

2. **Implemented improved hook architecture**:
   - ✅ New hooks follow clear dependency patterns
   - ✅ UI state is completely separate from business logic
   - ✅ All hooks properly use useCallback and useMemo with correct dependencies
   - ✅ New component structure leverages React's strengths

3. **Created reusable patterns for other components**:
   - ✅ Documented approach in README.md for other developers
   - ✅ New SportDataMapperV2 component showcases proper hook composition
   - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing components
