# SheetGPT Refactoring Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach for refactoring the SheetGPT codebase while maintaining continuous functionality and user experience.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (Low Risk, High Impact)

- [ ] **Standardize backend error handling**
  - [ ] Implement consistent patterns across services
  - [ ] Add better error categorization and logging
  - [ ] Maintain existing error response format for compatibility

- [ ] **Improve TypeScript typing**
  - [ ] Eliminate `any` types in critical paths
  - [ ] Create proper interfaces for API responses
  - [ ] Add type validation without changing implementation

- [ ] **Add missing database indexes**
  - [ ] Identify frequently queried fields
  - [ ] Implement indexes during low-usage periods
  - [ ] Verify performance improvements with benchmarks

## Phase 2: Service Layer Consolidation (Medium Risk)

- [ ] **Create base service class**
  - [ ] Extract common CRUD operations into a shared base class
  - [ ] Implement one service at a time, starting with simpler ones
  - [ ] Maintain identical API signatures for compatibility

- [ ] **Standardize entity type handling**
  - [ ] Normalize entity type values consistently
  - [ ] Consolidate entity type detection into a shared utility
  - [ ] Keep supporting legacy formats while adding new capabilities

- [ ] **Complete Brand entity integration**
  - [ ] Finalize remaining transition from legacy company models
  - [ ] Update frontend references to use unified Brand model
  - [ ] Add data migration scripts for cleaner database schema

## Phase 3: Hook Dependency Management (Medium Risk)

- [ ] **Resolve circular hook dependencies**
  - [ ] Identify hooks with circular references
  - [ ] Restructure with clearer boundaries
  - [ ] Apply successful patterns from EntityList refactoring

- [ ] **Extract UI state from business logic hooks**
  - [ ] Separate display state from data operations
  - [ ] Improve hook reusability
  - [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing components

- [ ] **Standardize error handling in hooks**
  - [ ] Create reusable error utilities
  - [ ] Implement consistent error patterns
  - [ ] Preserve existing error display behavior

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Medium-High Impact)

- [ ] **Implement consistent memoization strategy**
  - [ ] Apply useCallback and useMemo consistently
  - [ ] Add custom equality checks for complex objects
  - [ ] Profile components before and after changes

- [ ] **Optimize component renders**
  - [ ] Add React.memo for expensive components
  - [ ] Implement virtualization for large data tables
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders in nested components

- [ ] **Improve data fetching patterns**
  - [ ] Implement data caching where appropriate
  - [ ] Add pagination optimizations for large datasets
  - [ ] Enhance relationship data loading

## Phase 5: Enhanced Entity Resolution (High Impact)

- [ ] **Refactor entity resolution strategy**
  - [ ] Create unified entity resolution service
  - [ ] Standardize cross-entity lookups
  - [ ] Improve deterministic UUID generation

- [ ] **Enhance search and filtering**
  - [ ] Standardize filter implementations across entities
  - [ ] Optimize complex search queries
  - [ ] Improve relation-based filtering

- [ ] **Upgrade data validation**
  - [ ] Implement consistent validation patterns
  - [ ] Add comprehensive relationship validation
  - [ ] Improve feedback for validation errors

## Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure (Low Risk, High Value)

- [ ] **Expand test coverage**
  - [ ] Add tests for critical paths
  - [ ] Focus on high-value business logic
  - [ ] Create test factories for consistent test data

- [ ] **Implement integration testing**
  - [ ] Develop more robust integration test framework
  - [ ] Test complete workflows across frontend and backend
  - [ ] Automate end-to-end testing for critical paths

- [ ] **Enhance CI/CD pipeline**
  - [ ] Improve test automation in deployment
  - [ ] Add performance regression testing
  - [ ] Implement code quality gates

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **For every change:**
   - Create a feature branch for isolated development
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Validate both functionality and performance
   - Deploy to staging for thorough testing before production

2. **Communication strategy:**
   - Document each refactoring phase in advance
   - Schedule changes during lower usage periods
   - Provide clear rollback procedures
   - Communicate any brief maintenance windows

3. **Verification approach:**
   - Automated tests for all changes
   - Visual regression testing for UI components
   - Performance benchmarking before and after
   - Database integrity validation for data model changes
