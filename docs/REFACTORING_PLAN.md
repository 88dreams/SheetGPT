- [ ] **Enhance CI/CD pipeline**
  - [ ] Improve test automation in deployment
  - [ ] Add performance regression testing
  - [ ] Implement code quality gates

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **For every change:**
   - Create a feature branch for isolated development
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Validate both functionality and performance
   - Deploy to staging for thorough testing before production

2. **Communication strategy:**
   - Document each refactoring phase in advance
   - Schedule changes during lower usage periods
   - Provide clear rollback procedures
   - Communicate any brief maintenance windows

3. **Verification approach:**
   - Automated tests for all changes
   - Visual regression testing for UI components
   - Performance benchmarking before and after
   - Database integrity validation for data model changes
