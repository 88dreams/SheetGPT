# SheetGPT Refactoring Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach for refactoring the SheetGPT codebase while maintaining continuous functionality and user experience.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (Low Risk, High Impact)

- [x] **Standardize backend error handling**
  - [x] Implement consistent patterns across services
  - [x] Add better error categorization and logging
  - [x] Maintain existing error response format for compatibility

- [x] **Improve TypeScript typing**
  - [x] Eliminate `any` types in critical paths
  - [x] Create proper interfaces for API responses
  - [x] Add type validation without changing implementation

- [x] **Add missing database indexes**
  - [x] Identify frequently queried fields
  - [x] Implement indexes during low-usage periods
  - [x] Verify performance improvements with benchmarks

## Phase 2: Service Layer Consolidation (Medium Risk)

- [x] **Create base service class**
  - [x] Extract common CRUD operations into a shared base class
  - [x] Implement one service at a time, starting with simpler ones (League service updated)
  - [x] Maintain identical API signatures for compatibility

- [x] **Standardize entity type handling**
  - [x] Normalize entity type values consistently
  - [x] Consolidate entity type detection into a shared utility
  - [x] Keep supporting legacy formats while adding new capabilities

- [x] **Complete Brand entity integration**
  - [x] Finalize remaining transition from legacy company models
  - [x] Update services to use unified Brand model
  - [x] Add data migration scripts for cleaner database schema

## Phase 3: Hook Dependency Management (Medium Risk)

- [ ] **Resolve circular hook dependencies**
  - [ ] Identify hooks with circular references
  - [ ] Restructure with clearer boundaries
  - [ ] Apply successful patterns from EntityList refactoring

- [ ] **Extract UI state from business logic hooks**
  - [ ] Separate display state from data operations
  - [ ] Improve hook reusability
  - [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing components

- [ ] **Standardize error handling in hooks**
  - [ ] Create reusable error utilities
  - [ ] Implement consistent error patterns
  - [ ] Preserve existing error display behavior

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Medium-High Impact)

- [ ] **Implement consistent memoization strategy**
  - [ ] Apply useCallback and useMemo consistently
  - [ ] Add custom equality checks for complex objects
  - [ ] Profile components before and after changes

- [ ] **Optimize component renders**
  - [ ] Add React.memo for expensive components
  - [ ] Implement virtualization for large data tables
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders in nested components

- [ ] **Improve data fetching patterns**
  - [ ] Implement data caching where appropriate
  - [ ] Add pagination optimizations for large datasets
  - [ ] Enhance relationship data loading

## Phase 5: Enhanced Entity Resolution (High Impact)

- [ ] **Refactor entity resolution strategy**
  - [ ] Create unified entity resolution service
  - [ ] Standardize cross-entity lookups
  - [ ] Improve deterministic UUID generation

- [ ] **Enhance search and filtering**
  - [ ] Standardize filter implementations across entities
  - [ ] Optimize complex search queries
  - [ ] Improve relation-based filtering

- [ ] **Upgrade data validation**
  - [ ] Implement consistent validation patterns
  - [ ] Add comprehensive relationship validation
  - [ ] Improve feedback for validation errors

## Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure (Low Risk, High Value)

- [ ] **Expand test coverage**
  - [ ] Add tests for critical paths
  - [ ] Focus on high-value business logic
  - [ ] Create test factories for consistent test data
  - [x] Implement isolated unit tests for error handling components
  - [ ] Add mocking strategies for SQLAlchemy interactions

- [ ] **Implement integration testing**
  - [ ] Develop more robust integration test framework
  - [ ] Test complete workflows across frontend and backend
  - [ ] Automate end-to-end testing for critical paths

- [ ] **Enhance CI/CD pipeline**
  - [ ] Improve test automation in deployment
  - [ ] Add performance regression testing
  - [ ] Implement code quality gates

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **For every change:**
   - Create a feature branch for isolated development
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Validate both functionality and performance
   - Deploy to staging for thorough testing before production

2. **Communication strategy:**
   - Document each refactoring phase in advance
   - Schedule changes during lower usage periods
   - Provide clear rollback procedures
   - Communicate any brief maintenance windows

3. **Verification approach:**
   - Automated tests for all changes
   - Visual regression testing for UI components
   - Performance benchmarking before and after
   - Database integrity validation for data model changes

## Progress Tracking

| Phase | Started | Completed | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | 2025-03-28 | 2025-03-29 | Error handling, TypeScript typing, and database indexes completed |
| Phase 2 | 2025-03-29 | 2025-03-31 | Base service class enhanced, entity type standardized, Brand model integration completed |
| Phase 3 | 2025-03-31 | In progress | Identifying components with circular dependencies and UI state issues |
| Phase 4 | | | |
| Phase 5 | | | |
| Phase 6 | | | |

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. Identify React components and hooks with circular dependencies:
   - Look for hooks that reference each other
   - Check components that maintain complex UI state with data operations
   - Analyze the SportDataMapper components for best patterns to apply

2. Create a plan for reworking the hook architecture:
   - Define clear boundaries between data operation and UI state hooks
   - Design a new hook structure that separates concerns properly
   - Apply lessons learned from the EntityList refactoring

3. Begin refactoring hooks one component at a time:
   - Start with simpler components
   - Document patterns for others to follow
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
