  - Added row numbering for better data navigation
  - Ensured proper alignment of team names, cities, states, and stadiums

The key insight was that we needed to focus on the fundamental data structure rather than creating special cases for specific formats. By simplifying our approach and ensuring consistent transformation across all components, we've created a more robust solution that handles all data formats correctly.

## Data Handling Refactoring (Completed)

### Initial Issues
- Multiple transformation steps were occurring across different components
- Special case handling for specific data types (e.g., NFL teams data) created inconsistencies
- Redundant transformations were happening in different components
- Complex conditional logic made the code difficult to maintain
- Inconsistent approaches to data structures across the application

### Refactoring Goals
- Implement a universal data handling approach that works for all data formats
- Simplify the transformation pipeline to reduce complexity
- Reduce redundant code by centralizing data transformation logic
- Create a single source of truth for data format conversion
- Improve performance by eliminating unnecessary transformations
- Enhance debugging with consistent logging

### Implementation Summary
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive refactoring of the data handling system:

1. **Centralized Data Transformation**
   - Created a unified data transformer utility in `dataTransformer.ts`
   - Implemented standardized interfaces for data formats
   - Developed a single transformation pipeline that handles all data formats

2. **Standardized Data Extraction**
