# Relationship Field Sorting

This document describes the implementation of relationship field sorting across all entity types in the SheetGPT application.

## Overview

Relationship field sorting refers to the ability to sort entities based on fields that are actually properties of related entities. For example, sorting teams by their `league_name` (which comes from the related `League` entity) or sorting production services by their `production_company_name` (which comes from the related `Brand` entity).

## Implementation

The implementation consists of both frontend and backend components:

### Backend Implementation

In the backend, we've implemented a comprehensive solution for handling relationship field sorting in the `SportsService` facade:

1. **Relationship Sort Configuration**
   - Added a new method `get_relationship_sort_config` that maps entity types to their relationship fields
   - For each entity type, defines which related models need to be joined for specific sort fields
   - Handles special cases like polymorphic relationships (where entity_type is a field in the model)

2. **Sort Types**
   - **Direct Relationship Sorts**: Uses SQL JOINs for direct relationships (e.g., team.league_id -> league.name)
   - **Polymorphic Relationship Sorts**: Uses in-memory sorting after fetching and processing entities for polymorphic relationships

3. **Enhanced get_entities Method**
   - Detects if sorting by a relationship field using the configuration
   - For direct relationships, builds a query with the appropriate JOIN and sorts at the database level
   - For polymorphic relationships, retrieves entities and sorts them in memory after adding related names
   - Includes proper null handling with `nulls_last` for consistent ordering

4. **Improved get_entities_with_related_names Method**
   - Avoids redundant processing for entities that already include related names
   - Preserves sorting order from the database query

### Frontend Implementation

In the frontend, we've made the following changes:

1. **useSorting Hook**
   - Removed the `'none'` sort direction option for consistency
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging sorting behavior
   - Deprecated the client-side `getSortedEntities` function in favor of server-side sorting
   - Ensures that pagination is reset when sort criteria change

2. **SportsDatabaseContext**
   - Registers a pagination reset callback with the sorting hook
   - Passes sort parameters from the hook to the API request
   - Avoids client-side sorting for consistency across all entity types

3. **EntityList Component**
   - Uses server-side sorting exclusively for all columns
   - Properly maps column clicks to sort field names
   - Shows appropriate sort direction indicators

## Entity Types and Sortable Relationship Fields

The following entity types support relationship field sorting:

| Entity Type | Relationship Field | Related Model | Join Field |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| division_conference | league_name | League | league_id |
| team | league_name | League | league_id |
| team | division_conference_name | DivisionConference | division_conference_id |
| team | stadium_name | Stadium | stadium_id |
| player | team_name | Team | team_id |
| game | league_name | League | league_id |
| game | home_team_name | Team | home_team_id |
| game | away_team_name | Team | away_team_id |
| game | stadium_name | Stadium | stadium_id |
| game_broadcast | game_name | Game | game_id |
| game_broadcast | broadcast_company_name | BroadcastCompany | broadcast_company_id |
| game_broadcast | production_company_name | ProductionCompany | production_company_id |
| broadcast | broadcast_company_name | BroadcastCompany | broadcast_company_id |
| broadcast | entity_name | (polymorphic) | entity_id + entity_type |
| production | production_company_name | Brand | production_company_id |
| production | entity_name | (polymorphic) | entity_id + entity_type |
| league_executive | league_name | League | league_id |
| brand_relationship | brand_name | Brand | brand_id |
| brand_relationship | entity_name | (polymorphic) | entity_id + entity_type |

## Special Cases: Polymorphic Relationships

Some entities have "polymorphic" relationships, where `entity_type` and `entity_id` fields reference different tables based on the entity type. These include:

- BroadcastRights (`broadcast`)
- ProductionService (`production`)
- BrandRelationship (`brand_relationship`)

For these entities, sorting by `entity_name` requires special handling:

1. The backend fetches entities for the current page (with some buffer to ensure enough data)
2. EntityNameResolver adds related names based on the entity_type field
3. The entities are sorted in memory based on the entity_name
4. The first N entities are returned to match the requested page size

## Testing

A simple HTML-based test page is available at `/sort_test.html` that allows testing of relationship field sorting across different entity types. This page provides a UI for selecting entity types, sort fields, and sort directions, and displays the results in real-time.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Performance**: Sorting polymorphic relationships in memory is not ideal for large datasets. Future improvements could include:
   - Implementing materialized views for polymorphic relationships
   - Adding denormalized columns for frequently sorted fields

2. **Edge Cases**: Null handling could be improved further, especially for nested relationships.

3. **Indexing**: Some relationship fields might benefit from database indexes to improve query performance.

## Conclusion

With this implementation, we now have consistent sorting behavior across all entity types, including those with complex relationships. This ensures that users can effectively organize and navigate the data.
