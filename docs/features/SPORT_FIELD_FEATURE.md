# Sport Field Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Sport field feature ensures consistent sport-type information across all related entities. Originally implemented as a required field for Leagues, this feature was extended to make sport information visible and available across related entities (Divisions/Conferences, Teams, Broadcast Rights, Production Services).

## Implementation 

### Backend Changes
1. **Entity Name Resolver Updates**
   - Updated `entity_name_resolver.py` to include sport field when resolving League entities
   - Added league_sport field to Teams, Divisions/Conferences, Broadcast Rights, and Production Services
   - Enhanced allowed fields to include league_sport across related entity types

2. **Schema Updates**
   - Added league_sport field to response schemas for:
     - DivisionConferenceResponse
     - TeamResponse
     - BroadcastRightsResponse
     - ProductionServiceResponse

3. **Data Migration**
   - Created `update_league_sports.py` script to ensure all leagues have proper sport values
   - Implemented mappings for common leagues and NCAA sports

### Frontend Changes
1. **UI Updates**
   - Added sport field display in Division/Conference form
   - Added column display for sport in entity list views
   - Implemented filtering by sport across entity types

## Usage
1. Run the backend migration script:
   ```
   docker-compose run --rm backend python src/scripts/update_league_sports.py
   ```

2. Restart services:
   ```
   docker-compose restart backend frontend
   ```

3. Verification points:
   - Division/Conference edit form shows league's sport
   - Team listings include sport column
   - Broadcast Rights listings include sport column
   - Production Services listings include sport column

## Benefits
1. Consistent sport identification across entity types
2. Enhanced filtering capabilities
3. Better organization for NCAA sports divisions
4. Improved context for broadcast rights and production services

## Future Enhancements
- Sport-specific fields and validations
- Sport-based reports and analytics
