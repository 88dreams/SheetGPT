# SportDataMapper V2: Refactored Implementation

This directory contains a complete refactoring of the SportDataMapper component, implementing Phase 3 of the SheetGPT refactoring plan. The goal of this refactoring is to address circular dependencies between hooks, separate UI state from business logic, and implement best practices for React hook design.

## Key Improvements

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Each hook has a single responsibility
   - UI state is completely separated from data operations
   - No circular dependencies between hooks
   - Improved testability of each hook in isolation

2. **Enhanced Type Safety**
   - TypeScript interfaces for all hook inputs and outputs
   - Explicit typing for all function parameters and return values
   - Type exports through index.ts for consistent usage

3. **Optimized Rendering**
   - Proper use of useCallback for event handlers
   - useMemo for computed values
   - Clearly defined dependencies for all effects and callbacks

4. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Comprehensive documentation for each hook
   - Clear naming conventions for functions and variables
   - Consistent patterns across all hooks

## Hooks Overview

### `useUiState`
Manages all UI-related state (view mode, walkthrough steps, field help, etc.) without any data dependencies. This hook can be tested and used completely independently.

### `useNotifications`
Handles notification display, timing, and dismissal. Completely decoupled from other hooks and can be reused across components.

### `useFieldMapping`
Manages mappings between source fields and target entity fields, organized by entity type. No longer has circular dependencies with other hooks.

### `useRecordNavigation`
Manages navigation between records, tracking excluded records, and providing record statistics. Takes data array as a parameter but doesn't depend on other hooks.

### `useDataManagement`
Handles data extraction, processing, and transformations without creating circular dependencies with other hooks.

### `useImportProcess`
Handles the process of importing data to the database, with proper separation from notification and UI state.

## Usage

The `SportDataMapperV2.tsx` component demonstrates how to use these refactored hooks together. The key pattern is to:

1. Initialize hooks in dependency order
2. Pass only the necessary data between hooks
3. Handle component-specific logic in the component itself
4. Use React's useEffect with proper dependencies for interactions between hooks

## Migration Strategy

This refactoring preserves all the existing functionality while improving the code structure. The existing components are still used, making this a non-breaking change that can be introduced gradually.

To migrate from v1 to v2:

1. Add the v2 components alongside the existing ones
2. Test the v2 implementation thoroughly
3. Switch imports to use the v2 components once validated
4. Remove the original implementation when safe

## Future Improvements

1. Add comprehensive unit tests for each hook
2. Enhance error handling with more specific error types
3. Add performance optimizations like virtualization for large datasets
4. Consider adding a context provider for global state if needed
