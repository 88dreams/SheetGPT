/**
 * EntityList Component - Displays and manages entity data in a table with bulk operations
 * 
 * This component is designed to work similarly to the DatabaseQuery component for consistency:
 * - Shows entities in a table with column visibility controls
 * - Supports selecting rows for bulk editing
 * - Uses column resizing and sorting
 * - Column visibility is saved per entity type
 */

// Import the refactored component
import EntityList from './EntityList/index';

// Re-export the component
export default EntityList;
