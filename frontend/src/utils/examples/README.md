# Fingerprinting Utility Examples

This directory contains example components demonstrating the usage of the fingerprinting utility for optimizing React component rendering performance.

## FingerprintExample.tsx

This example demonstrates:

1. How to use React.memo with custom equality functions created with `createMemoEqualityFn`
2. How to use fingerprints in dependency arrays of React hooks
3. How to compare complex objects efficiently with the `areEqual` function
4. The performance benefits of memoization with proper object comparison

## Usage Guidelines

- Use fingerprinting for complex objects in dependency arrays
- Apply React.memo with custom equality functions for expensive components
- Use specialized comparators for dates and arrays when appropriate
- Configure depth and other options based on your specific use case

## Performance Considerations

- The fingerprinting process itself has a cost, so don't use it for simple primitive values
- Consider the trade-off between fingerprinting depth and performance
- For frequently changing data, keep depth low (1-2) for better performance
- For deeply nested objects that rarely change, use higher depth values (3-5)

## Integration with Existing Components

To apply these techniques to existing components:

1. Identify expensive components that re-render frequently
2. Wrap them with React.memo using createMemoEqualityFn
3. Use fingerprints in dependency arrays for useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback
4. Apply specialized comparators for specific data types when needed
